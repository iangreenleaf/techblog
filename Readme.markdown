# Tech Notes Blog #

This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is mine. Okay, a couple of the others are mine too.

You can see it at http://technotes.iangreenleaf.com/.

It is served as a fully static site compiled by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll). This would be an even better idea if I actually knew Haskell.
